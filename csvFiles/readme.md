# csvFiles
This contains the CSV files that were used to create the outputs folder.

## Example for googleTest.py's CSV:

> Ticker,Shares,Price,BNeawe iBp4i AP7Wnd
> <br />AAPL,20,115.75,
> <br />TSLA,25,425.79,
> <br />XFGA,10,0,
> <br />^GSPC,5,3453.57,
> <br />SPX,5,3455.67,

## Example for oneSearch.py's CSV:
> Ticker,Shares,Price
> <br />AAPL,20,115.75
> <br />TSLA,25,425.79
> <br />XFGA,10,0
> <br />^GSPC,5,3453.57
> <br />SPX,5,3455.67

**googleTest.py**'s CSV file includes the gibberish whereas **oneSearch.py**'s CSV file does not need it. You can include the gibberish for both, if that is easier. Doing so will not mess up **oneSearch.py**.
